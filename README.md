The Hangman game is a classic word guessing game that involves a player trying to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. If the player guesses incorrectly, a part of a hangman is drawn. The game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or the drawing of the hangman is completed. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how the Hangman game works, including its components and the underlying logic:

Components of the Hangman Game
Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words. This is typically done using the random module in Python.
Game State:
Guessed Letters: A list to keep track of letters that the player has already guessed.
Guessed Words: A list to keep track of full words that the player has guessed.
Tries: A variable to count the number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends (in this case, 6 tries).
Word Completion: A string representing the current state of the word, with unguessed letters replaced by underscores (_).
User Input: The player is prompted to guess either a single letter or the entire word. The game checks whether the guess is valid and whether it has been guessed before.
Game Logic:If the player guesses a letter:

Check if it has been guessed before.
If it has not, check if the letter is in the word.
If the letter is in the word, reveal its positions in the word_completion string.
If it is not, decrement the tries counter.
If the player guesses the entire word:
Check if it matches the actual word.
If it is incorrect, decrement the tries counter.
The game continues until the word is fully guessed or the player runs out of tries.

Display:
After each guess, the game displays the current state of the hangman (using ASCII art) and the current state of the word, showing correctly guessed letters and underscores for unguessed letters.


Conclusion
The Hangman game is a simple yet engaging way to practice programming logic, control structures, and user input handling. It can be expanded with more features, such as a graphical user interface, difficulty levels, or a larger word database.
